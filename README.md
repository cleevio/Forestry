# Forestry: A Swift iOS Logger

Our team envisioned a versatile logging framework for iOS projects that could cater to specific logging needs with ease. We aimed to facilitate switching between logging services without causing any disruptive changes to the existing codebase. Today, we proudly present to you Forestry - an open-source logging library designed to meet these objectives.

## Features

- Lightweight logging solution without external dependencies
- Easily extensible
- Supports major external logging services out of the box
- Written with Swift
- The public API of ForestryLoggerLibrary has full test coverage. Integration of services has so far been tested only manually when integrated into our projects.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Xcode 11+ is required to build Forestry iOS Logger using Swift Package Manager.

To integrate Forestry iOS Logger into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager, add it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift:

```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/cleevio/Forestry", .upToNextMajor(from: "3.0.0"))
]
```



## Usage/Examples

Core of library is `ForestryLogger` struct. During initialization you provide logging services to log to

Common usage is as follows: 
```swift
#if DEBUG
public let log = ForestryLogger(services: [ConsoleLogger()])
#else
public let log = ForestryLogger(services: [ConsoleLogger(), SwiftyBeaverLogger()])
#endif
```

It is also possible to instantiate services with convenience functions:
```swift
public var log = ForestryLogger(service: .console)
public var log2 = ForestryLogger(services: [.console, .datadog(clientToken: "", environment: "", serviceName: "")])
```

You can always expend the functionality by creating your own logging service via conforming to the `LoggerService` protocol.

## TODO

- Implement Thread support in log() function if possible
- Implement handling UserInfo in SwiftyBeaverLogger
- Implement privacy support
- Implement support for other platforms
